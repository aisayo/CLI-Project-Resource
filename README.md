# CLI Project Time!!

## Starting the project: 
### [This should be the first thing you do before you start coding]
### Why you ask? You want to be able to commit your changes as you build your app 
### What are commits? [Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#:~:text=A%20commit%2C%20or%20%22revision%22,who%20made%20them%20and%20when.)

- First you will need to make a folder/directory on your computer. [Local]
  - Command for making a director is: `mkdir [file_name]` i.e. `mkdir cli_project`

- Once you have created a local directory, you will need to create a remote repository.
- You will need to sign into Github, and then navigate to the `+` sign in the upper right corner and click `new repository`
